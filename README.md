This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Generation of shape complexity through tissue conflict resolution"
Alexandra B Rebocho, Paul Southam, J Richard Kennaway, J Andrew Bangham, and Enrico Coen. eLife 2017;6:e20156. [10.7554/eLife.20156](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156)

The models are in the folders:

GPT\_Domes\_20161213  GPT\_Full\_Snapdragon\_20161213  GPT\_Wedges\_20161213

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
